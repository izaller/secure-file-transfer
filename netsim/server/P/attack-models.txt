Attack models

attack objectives:
    – systematic decoding of plaintexts
    – figuring out the key (breaking the key)

attacker capabilities:
    – ciphertext-only attack (basic model)
    – known-plaintext attack (example?)
    – (adaptive) chosen-plaintext attack (example?)
    – (adaptive) chosen-ciphertext attack (example?)

attack complexity measures:
    – data complexity
    – storage complexity
    – processing complexity
        » expected number of “basic operations” required for the attack
        » parallelization may reduce attack time but not processing complexity!
