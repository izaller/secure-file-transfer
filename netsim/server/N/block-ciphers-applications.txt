Applications of block ciphers

primarily:
– encryption of data (of any size, not just one block) --> confidentiality

Can also be used as a building block for:
– MAC functions à message integrity and authentication services
– hash functions
– PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator)
– key-stream generators for stream ciphers
