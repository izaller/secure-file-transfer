Random function model

collision resistant hash functions can typically be modeled as a
random function (similar to block ciphers)

illustration:
– SHA1("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
    gives hexadecimal: 2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849ee1bb76e7391b93eb12
– SHA1("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cog")
    gives hexadecimal: de9f2c7fd25e1b3afad3e85a0bd17d9b100db4b3
– the second hash differs from the first one in 81 (out of 160) bits
    (avalanche effect)
