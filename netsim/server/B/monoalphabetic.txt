generalization of the Caesar cipher
    -- replacement of letters is determined by a permutation

plain:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
cipher: H T K C U O I S J Y A R G M Z N B V F P X D L W Q E
example: BRUTUS --> TVXPXF

key = the permutation
key space is huge: 26! ~ 1.56*2^88

attack:
in case of monoalphabetic substitution, the ciphertext
preserves the letter statistics of the original plaintext!
    â€“- after decoding the most frequent and least frequent
        letters, the rest of the text can be figured out much
        like solving a crossword puzzle
