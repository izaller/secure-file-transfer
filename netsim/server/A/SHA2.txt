SHA2

SHA-2 is a family of iterative hash functions published by NIST in
2001
– SHA-256 and SHA-512 are new hash functions with identical structure
    but different word size (32 and 64 bits, respectively)
– SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512,
    respectively, and they use different CV0 values
– SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512,
    but the CV0 values are generated using a special method described in
    the FIPS 180-4 standard
– numbers in the name specify the output size, e.g., SHA-256 produces
    256 bit hash values
