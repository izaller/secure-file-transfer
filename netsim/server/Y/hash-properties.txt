Desired properties of hash functions

ease of computation
– given an input x, the hash value H(x) of x is easy to compute

weak collision resistance (2nd preimage resistance)
– given an input x, it is computationally infeasible to find a second input x’
    such that H(x’) = H(x)

strong collision resistance (collision resistance)
– it is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs x and x’
    such that H(x) = H(x’)

preimage resistance (one-way property)
– given a hash value y (for which no preimage is known), it is
    computationally infeasible to find any input x such that H(x) = y
