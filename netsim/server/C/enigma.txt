The enigma machine was the first electro-mechanical cipher.
It was adopted by the German Army in 1926 and used heavily
by Germans in WWII.

Components:
    -- keyboard: for input of the plaintext / ciphertext
    -- lampboard: for display of the ciphertext / plaintex
    -- plugboard: for swapping some input letter pairs
    -- scrambler unit (including the rotors): producing the
        ciphertext from the plaintext (and vice versa)

What determines the Enigma key?
– letter pairs swapped (e.g., A/L – P/R – T/D – B/W – K/F – O/Y)
– order of rotors in the slots (e.g., II – III – I)
– initial position of the rotors (e.g., R – D – D)

What is the key space size?
100391791500 x 6 x 26^3 ~ 2^53

yet, Enigma was broken by the Allies in WWII
– exploiting protocol weaknesses and weak keys
– code breaking was partly automated --> birth of first computers
– credit goes to Marian Rejewski and Alan Turing

every morning, the Germans distribute a daily setting to their units
-- however, they do not directly use the daily setting to encrypt messages
-- instead:
    – they generate a fresh message key (letter triplet for rotor positions) for every message
    – they encrypt the message key with the daily setting, and send this at the beginning of the
        communication
    – then they encrypt the message with the message key, and send it to the receiver
    – the receiver first decrypts the message key with the daily setting and then decrypts the
        message with the message key
-- in order to cope with errors during transmission, the message key is
   repeated twice at the beginning of the message!

Breaking enigma:
-- Rejewski thought that the repetition of the message key at the
beginning of the message is a weakness that may be exploited
-- a guess for the daily key can be confirmed by checking if decoding with the
guessed key produces a repeating letter triplet at the beginning of the
decoded message
-- the Polish codebreakers built a machine that tried different guesses
for the daily key in an automated way
    – the machine consisted of 6 Enigma copies (each corresponding to one of the
        6 possible rotor orders)
    – the machine continuously modified the position setting of the rotors, and
        attempted decrypting some intercepted message, until it found the daily key
-- from 1933, Poles were able to routinly break encrypted German communications

in December 1938, the Germans increase the security of the Enigma
– 2 new rotors (operators have to choose 3 rotors out of 5, and the order in
which they are put in the machine à this increases possible rotor
placements from 6 to 60)
– increase the number of letter pairs swapped on the plugboard from 6 to 10
– key space grows to ~266

in April 1939, Hitler breaks the non-aggression treaty with Poland
in July 1939, Poland reveals their Enigma breaking capability to
England
on August 16, 1939, the design documents of the Enigma breaking
machine are transferred to London
on September 1, 1939, Germany invades Poland

some weaknesses exploited by the British
– cillies
    » German Enigma operators sometimes used very weak (far from random)
    message keys (e.g., QWE, BNM)
    » an operator always used the same message key (C.I.L.) – perhaps the
    initials of his wife or girl friend?
    » these weak keys were called cillies (~silly)
– Germans had usage constraints that actually weakened their system
    » rotor order had to be changed every day, and the same rotor must not be
    placed in the same slot on two consecutive days
    » e.g., after I-II-V, they could not use III-II-IV
    » this actually reduced the size of the key space that the British had to search
    over

in September 1939, Alan Turing joins the code breakers in Bletchley Park
-- his task is to find a new method for breaking the cipher that does not rely on the
repetition of the message key at the beginning of the coded message
-- Turing invents a new method that is essentially an attack known today as the
known-plaintext attack
    – German messages are well structured
    – some messages contain guessable words at guessable locations
    – e.g., every morning at 6am, they send a weather forecast, which includes
        the world ”wetter” always at the same position within the message
-- the British build new Enigma breaking machines (Victory, Agnus Dei) based on
the plans of Turing in 1940
-- indeed, Germans change their message key sending protocol in May 1940, but
this does not affect the cryptanalytic capabilities of the British anymore
