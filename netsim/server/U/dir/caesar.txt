The caesar cipher was used by Julius Caesar. It is a
substitution cipher (replaces letters of the plaintext).
Each letter is replaced by the letter at some fixed
number of positions (e.g., 3) down in the alphabet.

plain:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
cipher: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
example: BRUTUS --> EUXWXV

key = value of the shift (of the alphabet)
size of the key space is 26-1 = 25 Ã  easy to break
