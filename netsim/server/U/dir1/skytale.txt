The skytale cipher was used by the Spartans in the 3rd century BC.
It is a transposition cipher (mixes letters of the plaintext).

A strip of leather was wrapped around a wooden rod, the message was written,
and the strip was unwrapped and transported. To "decrypt" the scrambled
message, Spartans re-wrapped the leather around a rod of the same size
to read the plaintext.

key = diameter of the rod
keyspace was small therefore easy to break!
