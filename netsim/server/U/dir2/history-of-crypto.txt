The history of cryptography in a nutshell:

until the second half of the 20th century:
    – cryptography = encryption, ciphers
    – almost exclusively used in military and diplomacy
in the second half of the 20th century:
    – cryptography is increasingly used in business applications (banking,
electronic funds transfer)
    – besides confidentiality, integrity protection, authentication, and non- repudiation became important too
at the end of the 20th century:
    – cryptography is used in everyday life of people (although they may be unaware of that)
    » web transactions, mobile devices, WiFi, Bluetooth, smart cards, ...
21st century:
    – certain cryptographic algorithms are endangered by quantum computing
    – post-quantum cryptography gains momentum
