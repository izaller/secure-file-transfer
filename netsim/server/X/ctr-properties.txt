Properties of CTR

it is crucial that counter values do not repeat, otherwise…
– given Y = EK(ctr) + X and Y’ = EK(ctr) + X’,
    the attacker can compute Y + Y’ = X + X’
– hence, if X (or part of it) is known then X’ (or part of it) is disclosed

does not provide any integrity protection
– similar to the case of steam ciphers, an attacker can perform controlled
modifications on the plaintext by manipulating the ciphertext

does not increase message length (unlike CBC with padding)

in addition, CTR mode is parallelizable, and allows for random
access and pre-computation
