Padding for block encryption

the length of the message may not be a multiple of the cipher’s
block size

we must add some extra bytes to the short end block such that it
reaches the correct size – this is called padding

the receiver must be able to unambiguously recognize and
remove the padding

due to this unambiguity requirement, padding is actually always
used, even in the case when the length of the original message is
a multiple of the block size (in this case, an entire extra block is
added to the message)
