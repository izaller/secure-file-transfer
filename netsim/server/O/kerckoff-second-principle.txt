Kerckhoff's second principle

Kerckhoffs’ 2nd Principle says that it must be assumed that the
encryption algorithm is known to the attacker. In other words,
the security of the system cannot depend on the secrecy of the
algorithm (no security by obscurity).

advantages of adherence to the 2nd Principle:
    -– secrecy of an algorithm can be broken by reverse engineering the
        implementation or by leaking out design documents (many examples)
    -– published designs undergo public scrutiny
    -– it is better if security flaws are revealed by “white hat guys”
    -– public designs allow for standards
