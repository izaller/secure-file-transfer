Properties of the one-time pad

perfect secrecy
    –- informally: observing the encrypted message provides no information (in
        an information theoretic sense) about the original message
    -– formally: H(m|c) = H(m), where H(x) is the entropy of x

large key size
    -– needs a truly random key that has the same length as the (compressed)
        message

impractical in many applications
    -– how to send the key in a secure way to the recipient?
    -– in practice, the only possibility is to exchange a large amount of truly
        random key material in an out-of-band manner (e.g., by physical
        meeting, via a quantum channel) before the communication takes place
    -– we have to do this with all potential communication partners
    -– key management becomes cumbersome
