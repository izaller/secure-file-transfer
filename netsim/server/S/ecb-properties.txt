Properties of ECB

encrypting the same plaintext with the same key results in the
same ciphertext (no randomization)
identical plaintext blocks result in identical ciphertext blocks
(under the same key of course)
– messages to be encrypted often have very regular formats
– repeating fragments, string of 0s, ... are quite common
does not properly hide patterns in the plaintext

overall: not recommended for messages longer than one block,
or if keys are reused for more than one block
