Stream ciphers

idea: simulate the truly random key stream of the one-time pad
with a pseudo-random sequence generated from a random seed

the key stream is generated independently of the plaintext and of
the ciphertext – key K is used to initialize an internal state s (seed the generator)
– once initialized, the state is updated using some function f after each step
– the output is generated from the state with another function g

effective size of the state space must be large
– otherwise the key stream starts repeating
– if two plaintext characters mi and mj are encrypted with the same key character z,
then the XOR sum of the ciphertext characters (mi + z) + (mj + z) = mi + mj
