The secret history of public key cryptography

James Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson
worked for GCHQ (British security agency). In 1969, Ellis
defined the general model of asymmetric key cryptography
(called it non-secret key coding). In 1973, Cocks invented
a cryptosystem same as RSA:
– he was introduced to the idea of non-secret key crypto
– he worked in the field of number theory, and immediately
  thought of using factoring as an underlying hard problem

In 1974, Williamson (a friend of Cocks) invented a key
exchange protocol same as the Diffie-Hellman protocol.
By 1975, Ellis, Cocks, and Williamson worked out all the
major results of public key cryptography, which were
(re)invented some years later the story was made public
only in 1997.
