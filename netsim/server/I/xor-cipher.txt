encryption
    –- represent the plaintext as a sequence of bytes
    –- take a password and repeat it many times to get a byte string as long as the plaintext
    –- obtain the ciphertext by XOR-ing together the plaintext and the password string

decryption
    –- XOR the same password string to the ciphertext to recover the plaintext
