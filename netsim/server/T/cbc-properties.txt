Properties of CBC

encrypting the same plaintexts under the same key, but
different IVs result in different ciphertexts

ciphertext block Yi depends on Xi and all preceding plaintext
blocks
– however, dependency on the preceding plaintext blocks is only via the
previous ciphertext block Yi-1
– hence, proper decryption of a correct ciphertext block needs a correct
preceding ciphertext block only (chosen ciphertext attacks are possible)

self-synchronizing property:
– automatically recovers from loss of a ciphertext block

parallel computation (only for decryption), random access, no
pre-computation
