Block ciphers

Block ciphers operate on blocks of bits (typical block size is n = 128 bits).
They are stateless (unlike stream ciphers). They cannot be efficiently
distinguished from a random permutation. If K is unknown, the output is
unpredictable (even parts of it, and even when some input-output pairs are known)
