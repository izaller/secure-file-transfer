Block cipher usage modes

we usually need to encrypt messages that are longer (or
shorter) than the block size of the block cipher
we can use the block cipher in different ”encryption modes”
basic modes:
    – Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode
    – Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode
    – Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode
    – Output Feedback (OFB) mode
    – Counter (CTR) mode
authenticated encryption modes (will be covered later)
    – CCM: CTR + CBC MAC
    – GCM: Galois CTR mode
    – OCB: Offset Codebook Mode
